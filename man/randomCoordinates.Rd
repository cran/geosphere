\title{
Random or regularly distributed coordinates on the globe
}

\description{
randomCoordinates returns a 'uniform random sample' in the sense that the probability that a point is drawn from any region is equal to the area of that region divided by the area of the entire sphere. This would not happen if you took a random uniform sample of longitude and latitude, as the sample would be biased towards the poles.

regularCoordiaates returns a set of coordinates that are regularly distributed on the globe.
