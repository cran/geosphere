\title{
Intersections of two great circles
}

\description{
Get the two points where two great cricles cross each other. In this function, great circles are defined by a points and an initial bearing. In function \code{ \link[geosphere]{gcIntersect}} they are defined by two sets of points.
}

\usage{
gcIntersectBearing(p1, brng1, p2, brng2) 
}

\arguments{
  \item{p1}{longitude/latitude of point(s). Can be a vector of two numbers, a matrix of 2 columns (first one is longitude, second is latitude) or a SpatialPoints* object}
  \item{brng1}{Bearing from p1}
  \item{p2}{As above. Should have same length as p1, or a single point (or vice versa when p1 is a single point}
  \item{brng2}{Bearing from p2}
}


\value{
a matrix with four columns (two points)
}
