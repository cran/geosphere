26 August 2010
New functions:
distPoint2Lines computes the (spherical) distance between points and polylines (and polygons borders).
makeLine (like makePoly), adds intermediate great circle points to line segments, for better plotting
onGreatCircle tests if points are on a specified great circle

distVincentyEllipsoid now handles NA values. Bug fix suggested by George Wang.
